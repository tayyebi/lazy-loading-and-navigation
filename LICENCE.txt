                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2, June 1991

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if
you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this License which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

   Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputation.

   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
We wish to avoid the danger that a free program will be non-free, or even
proprietary, because a patent license applied to it could make it
non-free.  Therefore, we wish to make sure that all the free software
developers get patent licenses for their programs.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this General Public License.  The "Program", below, refers to any such program or
work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative
work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
modification.)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by
this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is not
restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute
a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the
Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as
you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately
publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty
and keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it,
thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such
modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also
meet all of these conditions:
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
       that you changed the files and the date of any change.
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in
       part contains or is derived from the Program or any previous work based on
       the Program, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
       under the terms of this License.
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,
       you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most
       ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate
       copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, that you
       provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
       conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.  (Exception:
       if such a program does not normally print such an announcement, this requirement
       need not apply.)

 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2)
in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided
that you also do one of the following:
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,
       which must be distributed under the terms of this License, or, at your option,
       a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a
       charge no more than your cost of physically performing this distribution, a
       complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed
       under the terms of this License, or
    b) Accompany it with the information you received as to where the source code for
       the Program is available.  (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial
       distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form
       with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or
distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as they remain in full
compliance with those licenses.

 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.  However,
nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative
works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,
by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate
your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient
automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the
Program subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on
the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing
compliance by third parties with this License.

 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any
other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court
order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute the Program so as to
comply with both this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not distribute the Program at all.

 8. If the distribution of a work is restricted in certain countries either by patent law, copyright
law or other applicable laws, the original copyright holder who places the work under this
License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so
that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this
License becomes a geographically limited license and the above disclaimer of warranty does not
apply to the restricted distribution.  Nevertheless, this License remains applicable for works
distributed and licensed in other countries.

 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public
License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  Each version is given a distinguishing
version number.  If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.
If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any
version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

                           NO WARRANTY

  12. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM,
  TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
  COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
  KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE WARRANTIES OF
  MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.  IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
  COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY,
  WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH
  THE PROGRAM OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE PROGRAM.

                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
